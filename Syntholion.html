                Syntholion, formerly SynthioX, Apollo, and CoolioX, but commonly referred to as Coolio, landed in Vooperia on September 9th, 2018, and went to settle in <a href="Voopmont">Voopmont</a>. He was widely popular among other citizens and fellow <a href="Voopmontian">Voopmontians</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                There, he quickly rose through the ranks and became a very prominent part of the community. He was then elected the second senator of Voopmont after a near tie with <a href="Asdia0">Asdia0</a>.
            </p>

        <h2 id="First term as senator">First term as senator</h2>
            <p>
                Syntholion was elected on July 24th, 2020 as Senator of Voopmont. During his first term as senator, Syntholion was known for being a member of the <a href="New Vooperian Party">New Vooperian Party</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                He also ran for the First Prime Minister Elections, but received no votes. Near the end of his first term, he left the New Vooperian Party and began advocating for independent senators without bias. The reasoning he gave was due to the toxicity that the party had, and the fact that the party leader, PopeFrancis, was continually in drama, causing controversy for the party.
            </p>
            <p>
                He resigned from his role as senator due to a court case on September 1st, 2020.

        <h2 id="Voopmont University">Voopmont University</h2>
            <p>
                After his first term as senator, Syntholion began working on Voopmont University, a university which helped the previously poorly educated Voopmontians have the ability to take white-collared jobs.
            </p>
            <p>
                The university lasted a week, but was a financial success for him, making Â¢140,000 after the University's <a href="Closure of Voopmont University">downfall</a>.
            </p>

        <h2 id="Second term as senator">Second term as senator</h2>

            </p>
            <p>
                Near the end of his term as governor, a revolution in Medievala caused the nation to reform into the Second Lanatian Empire. The Second Lanatian Empire declared war on Voopmont and San Vooperisco, but lost due to the immense amount of soldiers, warships, and planes that Vooperia had compared to the Second Lanatian Empire. Senator Asdia0 and Governor Syntholion defended Voopmont during this time.
            </p>
            <p>
                He resigned as governor on December 20th, 2020.
